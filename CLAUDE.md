# CLAUDE.md — Kara Loft and the Illuminati (Amstrad CPC 6128)

Z80 assembly game for the Amstrad CPC 6128. The design document is [plan.md](plan.md)
(written in Greek); this file holds the technical contract that code must satisfy.
**Where this file and plan.md disagree, this file wins** — see §11 for the specific
corrections and why.

## 1. Status

**Modules 1 and 2 done.** `./build.sh` regenerates the assets, assembles, and
produces `build/kara.dsk`, which boots, relocates, sets Mode 0, passes its bank
self-test and runs an interrupt-driven main loop. `./tools/run_tests.sh` runs
every acceptance suite. Modules 3-7 (§11) are not started.

```
src/main.asm      bootstrap at &4000 + core engine at &0040
src/config.asm    ports and memory map constants
src/bank.asm      bank switching (must stay outside &4000-&7FFF)
src/screen.asm    Mode 0 addressing, block fill, palette, vsync
src/palette.asm   the 16 pens + solid-pen byte table
disc/disc.bas     ASCII BASIC loader

tools/cpclib.py            Mode 0 encoding, palette, screen layout - the one
                           place the bit interleaving is written down
tools/png2sprite.py        sprite sheet  -> data+mask binary
tools/png2screen.py        image         -> overscan.bin / 16K screen
tools/blender_title.py     the title scene and its CPC render settings
tools/make_placeholder_sprites.py
tools/test_*.py            acceptance suites
tools/run_tests.sh         all of them, in order

assets/placeholder/        stand-in sprite art, to be replaced
assets/title/              the title render
docs/                      hardware reference tables
```

Nothing INCBINs the asset binaries yet: Module 3 links the sprites, Module 6
the title screen. `build.sh` regenerates them anyway so they cannot drift.

## 2. Target platform (hard constraints)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Machine | Amstrad CPC 6128, 128 KB RAM (the extra 64 KB is required, not optional) |
| CPU | Z80 @ 4 MHz nominal; gate array wait states make every instruction a multiple of 1 µs |
| Video | Mode 0 in-game (160×200, 16 pens from 27 hardware colours) |
| Title screen | Overscan Mode 0, 192×272 pixels, 26,112 bytes of VRAM |
| Audio | AY-3-8912, 3 channels + 1 noise generator |
| Media | 3" floppy `.dsk` image, loaded by a BASIC loader |
| Frame | 312 scanlines × 64 µs = 19,968 µs = 79,872 T-states @ 50 Hz |

## 3. Toolchain (verified present on this machine)

| Tool | Location | Version |
|---|---|---|
| RASM (assembler) | `/usr/local/bin/rasm`, source in `/home/vasilhs/rasm` | v3.2.5 (Atlas) |
| iDSK (disk imager) | `/usr/local/bin/iDSK`, source in `/home/vasilhs/idsk` | 0.20 |
| Headless emulator | `/home/vasilhs/cpcemu/cpc.py` (+ `libcpcheadless.so`) | floooh/chips |
| Python | system `python3` 3.14 with Pillow 12.3 | — |
| ffmpeg | `/home/vasilhs/bin/ffmpeg` | for the audio pipeline |
| Blender | MCP tools (`mcp__Blender__*`) — no CLI binary on PATH | render pipeline |
| Aseprite | **not available** — no CLI and no MCP server is connected | see §7.2 |

RASM can emit the DSK itself via a `SAVE "GAME.BIN",start,length,AMSDOS,"kara.dsk"`
directive, which is usually simpler than post-processing with iDSK. Use iDSK when you
need to inspect or patch an existing image:

```bash
iDSK kara.dsk -l
```

The project uses the two-step route, wrapped in `build.sh`:

```bash
./build.sh
```

`-t 1` = binary, `-c` = load address, `-e` = execution address, `-f` = overwrite.

**`rasm` needs `-amper`.** Without it `&` is the bitwise AND operator and every
hex literal in this codebase fails to parse. `build.sh` passes it; any ad-hoc
`rasm` invocation must too.

## 4. Boot sequence

AMSDOS can only land the binary somewhere BASIC is not, and BASIC occupies
`&0170` upward — so the load address is `&4000`, which is exactly the banked
window nothing may live in. The code at `&4000` is therefore a **bootstrap, not
the engine**:

1. `DI`, `LD SP,&BFFF`.
2. Write `&8C` to the gate array: Mode 0, **both ROMs disabled**. The lower ROM
   must go before any execution at `&0040`, or reads from `&0000-&3FFF` come
   from the OS ROM instead of the relocated code.
3. Select RAM config `&C0` so the window is in a known state.
4. `LDIR` the core engine image down to `&0040` (source and destination do not
   overlap) and `JP` into it. There is no way back to BASIC after this.
5. The core rewrites `&0038` with `JP IRQ_HANDLER` before the first `EI`, since
   the firmware's handler went out with the lower ROM.

`ORG code,output` in RASM is what lets the core be assembled for `&0040` while
being stored in the file after the bootstrap.

## 5. Test loop — always verify in the emulator

Never declare a module working on a clean assemble alone. The headless emulator boots a
real 6128 ROM set, accepts a `.dsk`, and renders to a framebuffer, so every visual claim
is checkable. Run from `/home/vasilhs/cpcemu` (or add it to `sys.path`):

```python
from cpc import CPC
c = CPC()                      # boots a 6128
c.run_frames(200)              # reach the BASIC prompt
c.insert_disc("kara.dsk")
c.type_text('RUN"DISC\n')
c.run_frames(500)
c.screenshot("shot.png", aspect=True)
```

Useful members: `peek/poke`, `read_ram/write_ram`, `run_code(addr, code)`, `pc`,
`mode`, `crtc_screen_addr`, `palette()`, `framebuffer()` (1024×312, 8-bit indices into
the 32-entry hardware palette), `decode_screen_ram()`, `joystick(mask)`, `quickload()`.

Two gotchas learned from probing it:

* The framebuffer is **hardware-colour indexed**, not pen indexed. To recover pen
  numbers, either set a known ink mapping first or use `decode_screen_ram()`.
* `crtc_screen_addr` returns the raw R12/R13 value. Convert to a RAM address with
  `base = ((raw & 0x3000) << 2) | ((raw & 0x0300) << 1) | ((raw & 0xFF) << 1)`.
  Do not assume `&C000` — BASIC scrolling moves it.

One Mode 0 pixel spans 4 framebuffer columns; the visible area starts at x=64.

## 6. CPC 6128 hardware reference

### 6.1 Memory map (base 64 KB)

```
&0000-&003F  Z80 restart vectors + IM 1 interrupt handler
&0040-&3FFF  Core engine, scrolling engine, sound driver      (never banked out)
&4000-&7FFF  Level logic, collision data, entity management   (BANKED WINDOW)
&8000-&BFFF  Sprite buffers, background restore buffers, temp (never banked out)
&C000-&FFFF  Primary video RAM
```

### 6.2 Banking (gate array port `&7Fxx`)

Writing `&C0`–`&FF` to port `&7F` selects a RAM configuration. Only the `&4000-&7FFF`
window changes in the configurations this project uses:

| Config | `&0000` | `&4000` | `&8000` | `&C000` | Project use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `&C0` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | default / `BANK_RESTORE` |
| `&C4` | 0 | 4 | 2 | 3 | Levels 1–2 tiles, tilemaps, palette animation |
| `&C5` | 0 | 5 | 2 | 3 | Levels 3–4 tiles, subsea physics tables |
| `&C6` | 0 | 6 | 2 | 3 | Levels 5–6 tiles, space station assets |
| `&C7` | 0 | 7 | 2 | 3 | Overscan title buffer + NPC dialogue tables |

```asm
BANK_SET_C4:    ld   bc,&7FC4
                out  (c),c
                ret
```

**Three rules, all of them crash-class:**

1. The bank-switching routine itself must live outside `&4000-&7FFF` — put it in
   `&0040-&3FFF` or `&8000-&BFFF`.
2. The stack must never be inside the banked window, and never inside VRAM.
   `LD SP,&BFFF` at startup.
3. Any data structure read across a bank switch must be copied to base RAM first.

The overscan title screen is 26,112 bytes and does not fit one 16 KB bank; it is split
across two banks and assembled into VRAM in two passes.

### 6.3 Mode 0 pixel encoding — VERIFIED

Each byte holds 2 pixels, bits interleaved. Bit numbers on the right are the **pen
number's** bit weights (bit 0 = value 1, bit 3 = value 8):

```
byte bit 7 -> left  pixel (pixel 0), pen bit 0
byte bit 6 -> right pixel (pixel 1), pen bit 0
byte bit 5 -> left  pixel (pixel 0), pen bit 2
byte bit 4 -> right pixel (pixel 1), pen bit 2
byte bit 3 -> left  pixel (pixel 0), pen bit 1
byte bit 2 -> right pixel (pixel 1), pen bit 1
byte bit 1 -> left  pixel (pixel 0), pen bit 3
byte bit 0 -> right pixel (pixel 1), pen bit 3
```

Encode (`p0`, `p1` are pen numbers 0-15):

```python
byte = (((p0 >> 0) & 1) << 7) | (((p1 >> 0) & 1) << 6) \
     | (((p0 >> 2) & 1) << 5) | (((p1 >> 2) & 1) << 4) \
     | (((p0 >> 1) & 1) << 3) | (((p1 >> 1) & 1) << 2) \
     | (((p0 >> 3) & 1) << 1) | (((p1 >> 3) & 1) << 0)
```

Confirmed on the emulator by poking single bits into screen RAM and reading back the
rendered colour, and it matches `_decode_byte()` in `cpc.py`. **plan.md §4.2 states this
table with bits 0↔3 and 1↔2 swapped and is wrong** — an exporter built from the plan's
table produces scrambled palette indices. Every asset exporter must use the table above,
and every exporter needs a round-trip unit test (encode → decode → original pens).

### 6.4 Screen addressing

Standard (non-overscan) layout, 80 bytes per line, base `&C000`:

```
addr = base + (line & 7) * &0800 + (line >> 3) * 80 + x_byte
```

Advancing one scanline inside the blitter:

```asm
                ld   bc,&0800
                add  hl,bc          ; next scanline within the char row
                jr   nc,.same_row   ; crossed the 8-line boundary?
                ld   bc,&C050       ; +&C050 wraps to the next char row
                add  hl,bc
.same_row:
```

### 6.5 Overscan title screen (192×272)

CRTC registers. **One CRTC character = 2 bytes**, so R1=48 gives 96 bytes/line:

| Reg | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| R0 | 63 | horizontal total (64 chars) |
| R1 | 48 | horizontal displayed → 96 bytes/line → 192 Mode 0 pixels |
| R2 | 50 | horizontal sync position |
| R6 | 34 | vertical displayed → 34 × 8 = 272 scanlines |
| R7 | 35 | vertical sync position |

96 bytes × 272 lines = **26,112 bytes**. plan.md's "48 chars × 4 bytes = 192 bytes"
is arithmetically wrong but arrives at the correct 192-pixel width and the correct
total; use 96 bytes/line.

**The screen cannot be one buffer.** The CRTC only drives MA0-MA9 onto the address
bus, so one raster block reaches 1024 words = 2048 bytes. At 48 chars per line that
is 21 character rows, and overscan needs 34. So the screen is **two halves of 17
rows** (136 lines, 13,056 bytes each), each laid out exactly like a normal CPC
screen, with the display code re-pointing R12/R13 at the second half partway down
the frame:

```
offset within a half = (line AND 7) * &0800 + (line >> 3) * 96 + x   ; peaks at 15,967
```

Verified on the emulator, including the failure mode: programmed as 34 rows in one
buffer, rows 17-20 draw blank and the address counter folds back mid-row-21, redrawing
the top of the picture. `tools/test_overscan.py` asserts both directions.

`overscan.bin` is stored in **copy order** — half 0 raster blocks 0-7, then half 1 —
each block 17 rows × 96 bytes = 1,632 bytes, so the loader is eight LDIRs per half
rather than a scatter.

### 6.6 Palette and fades

Gate array port `&7F00`: write `&00-&0F` to select a pen (`&10` for border), then the
hardware colour value; the verified ink/hardware/port table is in
[docs/cpc_palette.md](docs/cpc_palette.md) and the game's 16 pens are in
`src/palette.asm`. Fades walk each pen through a luminance-ordered ramp toward
black and back; keep the ramp as a table, not as arithmetic on colour codes.

### 6.7 AY-3-8912

Accessed through PPI port A (`&F4`) with control on `&F6`. Register set: R0-R5 tone
periods, R6 noise period, R7 mixer, R8-R10 channel volumes, R11-R13 hardware envelope.
The music player runs from the 50 Hz interrupt. Channel C is the SFX carrier: gunshots
and hurt sounds steal it via the noise generator and volume envelope, then hand it back
to the music without a re-trigger click.

## 7. Asset pipeline

### 7.1 Sprites

Kara Loft is 16×48 pixels → 8 bytes wide × 48 lines.

```
data frame : 8 × 48 = 384 bytes
AND mask   : 8 × 48 = 384 bytes
total      : 768 bytes per frame
```

Mask convention: mask bits **set where the background shows through**, clear where the
sprite pixel is opaque, so the blitter does:

```
SCREEN = (SCREEN AND MASK) OR DATA
```

Because Mode 0 interleaves, a pixel's four mask bits are not adjacent: the left pixel
owns the odd bits (`&AA`) and the right pixel the even ones (`&55`). A transparent left
pixel therefore contributes `&AA`, not `&F0`.

**Mask and data are interleaved per byte**, so the blitter walks both with one pointer:

```
line 0:  mask0 data0 mask1 data1 ... mask7 data7
line 1:  ...

ld a,(de) : and (hl) : inc hl : or (hl) : inc hl : ld (de),a : inc de
```

Produced by `tools/png2sprite.py`, emitted for `INCBIN`, with a generated `.inc` of
frame count and sizes. Sprites are quantised against the pens in `src/palette.asm`,
not against their own image, so they match the level they are drawn over.

### 7.2 Aseprite is not available

plan.md assumes an Aseprite MCP server. Nothing on this machine provides Aseprite, so
the sprite front end reads PNG sheets via Pillow instead. Swapping in Aseprite later
changes nothing downstream — the output format is unaffected.

### 7.3 Blender

**Blender runs on Windows (5.2.1 LTS), not inside WSL.** Consequences:

* Render paths passed to `bpy` must be Windows paths (`C:\Users\vasilhs\...`); read
  the result back from WSL under `/mnt/c/...`.
* Blender cannot see this repository, so scripts are injected as source through
  `execute_blender_code` rather than imported by path.
* The EEVEE enum name differs between versions — this build has `BLENDER_EEVEE`, not
  `BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT`. Pick from `render.bl_rna.properties["engine"].enum_items`.

**The open Blender session contains unrelated unsaved work** (a scene of ~200 objects).
`tools/blender_title.py` therefore builds into its own scene, `KaraTitle`, never clears
anything, and restores the active scene when it finishes. Keep it that way.

Render settings that matter: 192×272 at 100%, and **pixel aspect 2:1**, because Mode 0
pixels are twice as wide as they are tall — without it the art is framed for a shape
the hardware never shows. Camera is orthographic, per plan.md.

`tools/png2screen.py` then picks 16 of the 27 hardware colours by usage, optionally
Floyd-Steinberg dithers (worth it — a render banded to 16 colours looks poor without
it), and writes `overscan.bin` plus a palette include and a preview.

## 8. Game architecture

### 8.1 Level flow

Six levels, each with its own scroll axis:

| # | Level | Scroll | Bank | Signature mechanic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | City | horizontal L→R | C4 | rooftop jumps, key → garage |
| 2 | Forest | horizontal L→R | C4 | branch platforms, spikes, statue-on-altar |
| 3 | Cave | vertical bottom→top | C5 | climbing, 3-symbol book/lever puzzle |
| 4 | Undersea | vertical top→bottom | C5 | buoyancy + oxygen, mines, live cables |
| 5 | Desert | horizontal L→R | C6 | sinking sand, coins → NPC hints |
| 6 | Space station | horizontal L→R | C6 | laser traps, keycards, boss |

FSM: `STATE_LEVEL_PLAY → STATE_LEVEL_CLEAR → STATE_CUTSCENE → STATE_LOAD_NEXT`.

### 8.2 Scrolling

* **Horizontal** — CRTC hardware scroll via R12/R13, coarse steps of 2 bytes
  (4 Mode 0 pixels). Each step refreshes one tile column at the incoming edge.
* **Vertical** — CRTC start-address offset by whole lines. Levels 3 and 4 use opposite
  directions; level 4 additionally applies upward buoyancy each frame unless the player
  swims down.
* Both update the start address **only after `HALT` / VBLANK sync** to avoid tearing,
  and both must handle seamless wrap-around of the 16 KB VRAM window.

Tiles are 16×16 pixels = 8 bytes × 16 lines. Tilemaps live in banked RAM.

### 8.3 Dual pistols

```
MAG_LEFT     0-7      rounds in left pistol
MAG_RIGHT    0-7      rounds in right pistol
ACTIVE_GUN   0/1      alternates every shot, left first
RELOAD_TIMER frames   1.2 s = 60 frames @ 50 Hz
AMMO_RESERVE bytes    clips add 14
```

14 bullets in flight max, one pool entry per round: `{active, x, y, direction, life}`.
Bullets move 4 pixels/frame and die on a solid tile. Reload is manual (Down+Fire) or
automatic when both magazines hit 0; during reload the player is slowed or frozen.

### 8.4 Game state

```asm
PLAYER_HP:        db 100     ; 0-100, medkit restores 35, capped at 100
KEYS_COUNT:       db 0
COINS_COUNT:      db 0
AMMO_RESERVE:     db 28
STATUES_HELD:     db 0
CURRENT_BOOK_ID:  db 0
```

Interaction handlers: `CHECK_KEY_DOOR`, `PLACE_STATUE`, `READ_BOOK_PUZZLE`,
`TALK_NPC_COIN`, `USE_MEDKIT`, all gated by an AABB test in `ENTITY_COLLISION_CHECK`.

## 9. Performance budget

A frame is **79,872 T-states**. Allow ~25% (≈19,900 T-states) for drawing Kara plus
background restore plus 14 bullets; the remaining 75% covers scrolling, tile refresh,
collision, AI, and the music player.

Count T-states in comments on any loop that runs per-scanline or per-entity. Remember
the gate array rounds instruction timings up to whole microseconds, so the practical
throughput is nearer 3.3 MHz than 4 MHz — measured frame counts in the emulator beat
hand-counted totals when the two disagree.

## 10. Conventions and pitfalls

* Hex is `&` prefixed (RASM/CPC style), not `0x` — which requires `-amper`.
* Labels `SCREAMING_SNAKE`, local labels `.dotted`.
* Prefer `EXX` / shadow registers over push/pop in inner loops; document which shadow
  set a routine clobbers, since the interrupt handler uses them too.
* `LD SP,&BFFF` explicitly at startup. An SP that drifts into `&C000-&FFFF` shows up as
  random screen corruption, not as a crash.
* AMSDOS keeps its buffers around `&A700-&BFFF`. That region is only safe once the
  firmware is out of the picture — if disc access is needed mid-game, move the stack and
  the sprite buffers accordingly.
* Test the overscan and hardware scrolling on **CRTC types 0, 1, 2 and 4**; type
  differences bite hardest on R3/R7 timing and on start-address latching.
* Test data and scratch output go in the scratchpad dir, not in the repo.
* `plan.md:Zone.Identifier` is a Windows download artefact; add `*:Zone.Identifier` to
  `.gitignore` when the repo gets one.

## 11. Module order

Build strictly in sequence; each module must assemble **and run in the emulator** before
the next one starts.

1. ~~**Memory architecture + build pipeline**~~ — done: bootstrap/relocator, bank
   switching, `build.sh`, BASIC loader, `.dsk` generation, `tools/test_module1.py`.
2. ~~**Asset exporters**~~ — done: `cpclib.py`, `png2sprite.py`, `png2screen.py`,
   `blender_title.py`, wired into `build.sh`, with round-trip and on-hardware tests.
3. **Sprite blitter + dual-pistol bullet pool** — masked 8×48 blit, `FIRE_BULLET`,
   `UPDATE_BULLETS`.
4. **Scrolling engine** — horizontal CRTC scroll and both vertical variants.
5. **Objects, puzzles, NPCs** — inventory, interaction handlers, AABB.
6. **Level FSM + cutscenes** — transitions, raster-interrupt water rise, palette fades.
7. **Audio** — `audio_pipeline.py` (ffmpeg → 3 channels), AY player in the 50 Hz
   interrupt, Channel C SFX priority.

## 12. Corrections to plan.md

Consult this list before implementing from the plan:

1. **Mode 0 bit table (§4.2)** — wrong; pen bits 0↔3 and 1↔2 are swapped. Use §6.3
   above, which was verified on the emulator.
2. **Overscan byte count (§4.3)** — a CRTC character is 2 bytes, not 4. R1=48 yields
   96 bytes/line, not 192. The resulting 192-pixel width and 26,112-byte total are
   correct.
3. **"19,968 T-states" (§6.1)** — 19,968 is the frame length in *microseconds*
   (312 × 64), not a T-state budget. The frame is 79,872 T-states; the intended ~25%
   sprite budget is ≈19,900 T-states.
4. **Aseprite (§5 Module 2)** — not installed and no MCP server for it; use a Python
   PNG encoder instead.
5. **"Overscan title buffer, 26 KB across 2 banks" (§4.1)** — right that it needs two
   buffers, but not because of bank size. It needs two because the CRTC cannot address
   more than 21 character rows in one raster block; the two halves are displayed by
   re-pointing R12/R13 mid-frame. See §6.5.
